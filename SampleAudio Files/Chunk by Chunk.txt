I have a couple of questions one is
how do we get rid of the flax in the arteries without
statins for example
and the second
question is if someone is detected with
say 90% blockage or something and having strength implanted is good or not
good good both question answer good they really good questions
you know about it shows Aryan engineer
taxi how did I know
how did I know
because only an engineer can illogical thing that is there a block where must be removed as a toilet block it must be removed now
if the toilet pipe is BLO
new pipe
but unfortunately the human body is non linear and non euclidean so you can't apply your Euclid in linear mathematics there
when the block starts as a child
you start God starts giving you bypasses
Fevicol collateral
so it's good it's good to have a block remember that
don't try to remove the block as a matter of fact we have developed a new system of yoga where you can produce blocks in those rare individuals unfortunately you don't Havelock

you know the Sanyasi in the Himalayas live up to
100 years
you and I don't leave Luna bhai we have too much oxygen here

so with the blocks coming nature has given the block
the heart will live longer
so don't try to remove that and whoever has told you they started will remove the block master told you to take the return of the
the golden path
now this is a very simple exercise
this is very simple and it has two things it does
it helps your heart to have intermittent hypoxia
you know every second part of the second you don't get oxygen rather have you get the oxygen so heart get stimulation and it produces the blocks and helps the blocks
and very simple and the same time
it exercises a beautiful muscle called so as major
it's a large muscle which starts in the chest at the back
and comes down to the pelvis and holds on and comes in attach itself to the ti
sorry few stimulate this muscle all the organs are stimulated everyday
in the human body
